# 30-days portfolio performance comparison between addresses/group of addresses

## System

- At the beginning spheres are here already at default size
- when an address is added and it's fetching, make it turn/show loading

- Get the 30-days portfolio value for addresses (covalent API)
- Format it
- Get the spheres for each of the 2 groups
- Add data for each day to an array for each sphere (date -> value)

## UI

- Add addresses left/right
- Start analysis (shrink addresses)
- Choose day (-30 days - today) -> Animate positions
- Start slideshow (loop through days)

3 tabs

- Choose day
- Slideshow
- Compare day x / day x (2 spheres for each sphere)

Scroll between days, on scroll up/down the days changes and the size as well.
Can go in both directions, the page scrolls with a smooth animation between dates and the spheres change size/color?
